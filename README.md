# image_classifier using Tensorflow
To obtain labelled images for training and testing is part of the dataset
collection and preprocessing process. To boost the speed of the model, resize the photos to a
uniform size and normalise the pixel values. Set the dataset up as training, validation, and testing
sets. The testing set analyses the performance of the final model, whereas the validation set aids in
hyperparameter tuning. We can create our own models or choose from a variety of pre-built ones
offered by TensorFlow, such as VGG and ResNet. Apply the training dataset to the model to train
it. Track the model's performance during training by keeping an eye on the accuracy and validation
loss. To enhance the model's functionality, experiment with various hyperparameter values. Using
the testing dataset, evaluate the trained model to determine how well it can generalise.
